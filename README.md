## Fretboard Trainer

[Try It](https://fret-trainer.herokuapp.com/)

This app allows you to master the fretboard by viewing a wide variety of scales and arpeggios in any key. A metronome is also included for rhythm practice

## Arpeggios

The 1st (Red), 3rd (Blue), 5th (Green), 7th (Yellow), and any other extensions (Pink) are shown on the fretboard. Perfect for learning how chords are built, and for finding inversions.

TODO: Detailed chord descriptions

## Scales

TODO: Have an option to show scale degrees. Also, the way the fretboard is drawn could be A LOT better.

## Metronome

Simple metronome for time keeping.

TODO: For some reason it starts on 0, so I gotta fix that.

More stuff coming soon! (Gotta add the other accidentals)
